            <h2>Reflection on "Twelve Pillars"</h2>
            <p> The book Twelve Pillars speaks on that twelve (12) principles if applied to one's life can be transformational in the way best way possible. The book follows the life of Micheal and his encounter with Charlie who ever so kindly shared his twelve (12) life principles which made him into the man he is today. The book centres around principles of internal and external nature stemming from health to relationships to finance to that of your impact on the world. Chapters 4 to 7 could be seen centring on internal improvements. Chapters 4 to 7 speak on how the people around you can make or break your progress in life, growth by continuously seeking new knowledge and continuous personal development, the importance of health, the importance of building relationships, this could go along with the phrase "Money can't buy happiness" We could argue that it definitely can but when asked what would we do most if not all would include enjoying that money along with people you hold dear to your heart as well as the importance of time.</p>

           <p> I can say I agree with these principles. I believe that a life filled with love and support, good health and strong mental backing is very enriching and fulfilling. As a very sentimental person, I've successfully been able to surround myself with beneficial and loving individuals as well as seeking growth. In terms of the application of this book to my life, I need to improve my health, be more consistent, work on my legacy, my time management and set more goals. I find it so creative that although they are 12 principles of by themselves selves the are interconnected and the achieve ment of one leads to the achieve ment of the other.  </p>
