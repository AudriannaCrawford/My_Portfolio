            <h2>Impact of My Personality</h2>
            <p>I tend to be a person who gets so frustrated when things don't go as planned (for example the crash that happened with my laptop deleting my assignment which I now have to redo). I tend to need a serious crying season, 2 or 3 sessions at that. Before I can push forward, however, this has helped me to keep trying even if I fail at least I tried. I'd say I'm a very emotional person with an overactive mind, which enabled me to go about finding creative ways to calm these emotions. A hobby of mine is doing nails or art which allows me to calm my self quiet my mind and help me to focus on one thing at a time.  </p>

            <h2>My Hero, My Mother</h2>
            <p> When I should ick my hero or someone I admire other than my mother. The lady who has done so much for me while striving to create a life of her own. To me, my mother is my hero because she is someone I hope to surpass, making her proud. To pick a quote I hold dear to my heart would be a little bit tedious steaming from "Go wash up the plate them" to "Never give up". But what I do know is her resilience and courage to keep pushing forward have encouraged me to succeed regardless of anything .</p>

            <p>Reflection on test results: Upon thorough research, I do find the characteristics of one who is an idealist align with that of myself. These few sentences:</p> 
<aside class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        "The real, practical world is only a starting place for Idealists; they believe that life is filled with possibilities waiting to be realised, rich with meanings calling out to be understood. This idea of a mystical or spiritual dimension to life, the "not visible" or the "not yet" that can only be known through intuition or by a leap of faith, is far more important to Idealists than the world of material things."

<p>Had me laughing at their accuracy since they vividly described me as a person it is uncanning</p>
